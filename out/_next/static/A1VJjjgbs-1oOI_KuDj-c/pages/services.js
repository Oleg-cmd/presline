Correspondingly, the reality is that all used equipment and all companies specializing in it are sold on the same conditions (despite possible assurances that this is not the case). The new equipment costs 5-10 times more than the former equipment in operation. And the cost of spare parts for used machine is the same, or more expensive (for equipment removed from production) than for the new one. Therefore, objectively, the cost of replacing a serious part or unit of the machine can cost half the cost of the used machine itself. Or maybe even more than its cost. Besides the cost of spare parts, sometimes serious disassembly and adjustment of the machine is required. Such work also costs money. That is, even if you let the seller to convince yourself to some guarantee - in reality, his income will not cover the cost of parts that may have to be replaced. I.e. the real guarantee he will simply not be able to fulfill. The only way out is 1 - INSPECTION of the equipment and testing it in operation by the customer himself (under his responsibility accordingly) or by our forces under the guarantee of launching by our service engineers. Thus, all possible additional costs for the repair of used equipment during commissioning are always borne by the customer, and in the case of an inspection they are kept to a minimum or not required at all. The customer can, however, pre-order, for example, a set of new shafts (most often just shafts that need to be replaced) or other parts to ensure smooth commissioning of the machine. We know very well why all our customers want to be 100 per cent sure that the used machinery they buy from us is in 100 per cent working order and that the depreciation is in line with the declared value. By putting tens or even hundreds of thousands of euros on the table, customers want to know for sure that this money will not be invested in scrap metal or in a car that will break down six months after purchase. In order to protect themselves, some buyers come to Europe to inspect the equipment themselves. This is especially true for deals involving the purchase of equipment worth 50,000 Euros or more, such as a 4-5 colourful offset machine, or a complete print shop. The solution is quite logical, but not always reasonable. Taking into account the fact that technicians are brought with units, inspection of the equipment by the director or the owner of the printing house of the customer, the result is quite doubtful because of the lack of the necessary skills of the latter. After all, in fact, so few managers of Russian printing houses have a printing education or from experience know where to look, to assess the condition of the machine. Alas, it is necessary to admit that many clients, examine the goods for a tick. To them it is much more important to be convinced of existence of the equipment, after all equipment payment to the European firm, though through the intermediary, demands certain confidence not only in quality of the goods, but also that the goods in general will be delivered. We also understand this, but to assess the state of technology, such visits have nothing to do with it. We do not hide the fact that Preslaine LLC technicians have more modest qualifications than the manufacturers' service personnel. But their function is to test and repair even complex equipment, such as 4-5 colorful printing machines, torches or folding machines, as well as packaging and loading to transport equipment of any kind is quite successful. That's why we, really evaluating our capabilities, have taken as a rule all expensive and complex equipment (CTP and FNA) to check with the help of services of manufacturing companies. No one but Heidelberg's service department can adequately assess the condition of the XL 74-5. In the same way, no one can check the Ryobi 524GX better than Ryobi England technicians. And only SCREEN technicians will be able to accurately test the SCREEN PTR4300S. If the client buys from our company the polygraphic equipment in cost more than 75 000 euros, it automatically receives the full conclusion from service service of the company-manufacturer of this kind of the equipment, irrespective of what equipment it is a question of. (cost of such service from 3 to 5 000 euros). This is the best possible quality warranty for used equipment. After all, the conclusion of the manufacturer's engineers describes the condition of all units and parts with 100 percent accuracy. Unlike regular technicians of used equipment suppliers (including ours), service engineers of manufacturers have the highest qualifications and are responsible for their work with the name of the company. We try not only to check the equipment with the help of the companies-manufacturers, but also to invite their service services for disassembly and loading of heavy and large machines. If you really care about the quality assurance of the purchased equipment, it makes direct sense not to fly to Europe by yourself, not to trust the suppliers on the word, and order a check on the condition of the machines from the manufacturer. Especially since this is already included in the price for large machines.
